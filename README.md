# Fashion

## Introduction
This project is an attempt to provide a solution to the Kaggle competition: [iMaterialist (Fashion) 2020 at FGVC7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imaterialist-fashion-2020-fgvc7/data). The dataset is using the one from the link. 

## Dataset
I am using my macbook to train, so I limited the dataset to 7133 pictures. I am using YOLOv8 to train.

## How to run
Download the whole dataset. Change the paths.json so that it reflects your file structure. Run `set_up_new_dataset.py` first, and then the `seperate_dataset.py`. Now you have the three folders.
